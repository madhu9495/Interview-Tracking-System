The company was incorporated on 29 December 1945, in Mumbai by Mohamed Premji as 'Western India Palm Refined Oil Limited', later abbreviated to 'Wipro'. It was initially set up as a manufacturer of vegetable and refined oils in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India under the trade names of Kisan, Sunflower and Camel.[1][6] The company logo still contains a sunflower to reflect products of the original business.

In 1966, after Mohamed Premji’s death, his son Azim Premji returned home from Stanford University and took over Wipro as its chairman at the age of 21.[7][8]

During the 1970s and 1980s, the company shifted its focus to new business opportunities in the IT and computing industry, which was at a nascent stage in India at the time. On 7 June 1977, the name of the company changed from Western India Vegetable Products Limited, to Wipro Products Limited.[6]

The year 1980 marked the arrival of Wipro in the IT domain. In 1982, the name was changed from Wipro Products Limited to Wipro Limited.[9] Meanwhile, Wipro continued to expand in the consumer products domain with the launch of "Ralak" a tulsi-based family soap and "Wipro Jasmine", a toilet soap.[6]

1966–1992[edit]
In 1988, Wipro diversified its product line into heavy-duty industrial cylinders and mobile hydraulic cylinders.[6] A joint venture company with the United States' General Electric in the name of Wipro GE Medical Systems Pvt. Ltd. was set up in 1989 for the manufacture, sales, and service of diagnostic and imaging products.[10] Later, in 1991, tipping systems and Eaton hydraulic products were launched. The Wipro Fluid Power division, in 1992, developed expertise to offer standard hydraulic cylinders for construction equipment and truck tipping systems. The market saw the launch of the "Santoor" talcum powder and "Wipro Baby Soft" range of baby toiletries in 1990.[10]

1994–2000[edit]
In 1995, Wipro set up an overseas design centre, Odyssey 21, for undertaking projects and product developments in advanced technologies for overseas clients. Wipro Infotech and Wipro Systems were amalgamated with Wipro in April that year.[10] Five of Wipro's manufacturing and development facilities secured the ISO 9001 certification during 1994–95. In 1999, Wipro acquired Wipro Acer.[11] Wipro became a more profitable, diversified corporation with new products such as the Wipro SuperGenius personal computers (PCs). In 1999, the product was the one Indian PC range to obtain US-based National Software Testing Laboratory (NSTL) certification for the Year 2000 (Y2K) compliance in hardware for all models.[12]

Wipro Limited joined hands with a global telecom major KPN (Royal Dutch telecom) to form a joint venture company "Wipro Net Limited" to provide internet services in India.[8] The year 2000 was the year Wipro launched solutions for convergent networks targeted at Internet and telecom solution providers in the names of Wipro OSS Smart and Wipro WAP Smart.[13] In the same year, Wipro got listed on New York Stock Exchange.[14] In early 2000 Wipro Vice Chairman Vivek Paul and Azim Premji approached KPMG Consulting Vice Chairman Keyur Patel and CEO Rand Blazer to form an mega-outsourcing joint venture between the two organizations..

2001–present[edit]
In February 2002, Wipro became the first software technology and services company in India to be certified for ISO 14001 certification.[15] Wipro also achieved ISO 9000 certification to become the first software company to get SEI CMM Level 5 in 2002.[16][17] Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting Group entered the market of compact fluorescent lamps, with the launch of a range of CFL, under the brand name of Wipro Smartlite.[18] As the company grew, a study revealed that Wipro was the fastest wealth creator for 5 years (1997–2002).[19][20] The same year witnessed the launch of Wipro’s own laptops with Intel's Centrino mobile processor.[21] Wipro also entered into an exclusive agreement with the owners of Chandrika for marketing of their soap in select states in India.[22][23] It set up a wholly owned subsidiary company viz. Wipro Consumer Care Limited to manufacture consumer care and lighting products.[24] In 2004 Wipro joined the billion dollar club.[25] It also partnered with Intel for i-shiksha.[26][27] The year 2006 saw Wipro acquire cMango Inc., a US-based technology infrastructure Consulting firm[28][29] Enabler, and a Europe-based retail solutions provider.[30] In 2007, Wipro signed a large deal with Lockheed Martin.[31][32] It also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oki Techno Centre Singapore Pte Ltd (OTCS)[32][33] and signed an R&D partnership contract with Nokia Siemens Networks in Germany.[34][35]

In 2012 Wipro Ltd. announced the demerger of its consumer care, lighting, furniture, infrastructure Engineering (hydraulicsand water and medical diagnostic business into a separate company to be named Wipro Enterprises Ltd.[43] The merger became effective from 31 March 2013.[44][45] The demerged companies together contributed about 10% of the revenues of Wipro Limited in previous financial year.[46][47]

In 2014, Wipro signed a 10 year $ 1.2 billion contract with ATCO, a Canadian Energy & Utilities corporation based out of Calgary, Alberta. This was the largest deal in Wipro's history.

WIPRO LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)

Depository Shares representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange. These condensed
consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Company’s Board of Directors on July
23, 2015.
2. Basis of preparation of financial statements
(i) Statement of compliance
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards and its interpretations (“IFRS”), as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Selected explanatory notes are included to explain events and transactions
that are significant to understand the changes in financial position and performance of the Company since the last
annual consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2015. These condensed
consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information required for full annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
(ii) Basis of preparation
These condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with International
Accounting Standard (IAS) 34, “Interim Financial Reporting”.
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements correspond to the classification provisions
contained in IAS 1(revised), “Presentation of Financial Statements”. For clarity, various items are aggregated in
the statements of income and statements of financial position. These items are disaggregated separately in the
Notes, where applicable. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in these
condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
All amounts included in the condensed consolidated interim financial statements are reported in millions of
Indian rupees (` in millions) except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding off, the
numbers presented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not
precisely reflect the absolute figures.
(iii) Basis of measurement
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention
and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items that have been measured at fair value as required
by relevant IFRS:
a. Derivative financial instruments;
b. Available-for-sale financial assets; and
c. The defined benefit asset/ (liability) is recognised at the present value of defined benefit obligation less
fair value of plan assets. 
9
(iv) Convenience translation (unaudited)
The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared and reported in
Indian rupees, the national currency of India. Solely for the convenience of the readers, the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, have been translated into
United States dollars at the certified foreign exchange rate of $ 1 = ` 63.59, as published by Federal Reserve
Board of Governors on June 30, 2015. No representation is made that the Indian rupee amounts have been, could
have been or could be converted into United States dollars at such a rate or any other rate.
(v) Use of estimates and judgment
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to
make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates
are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular,
information about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting
policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are included in the following notes:
a) Revenue recognition: The Company uses the percentage of completion method using the input (cost
expended) method to measure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage
of completion method accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. This
method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various
elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to complete
include estimates of future labor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting of these
contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, recognized
revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate
that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable.
b) Goodwill: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in
circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying value.
The recoverable amount of cash generating units is higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell.
The calculation involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which includes turnover and earnings
multiples, growth rates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount
rate, future economic and market conditions.
c) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company are India and the United States of America.
Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment on
whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve
complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods.
d) Deferred taxes: Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the
reporting date. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future
taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become
deductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future
taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered
realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward
period are reduced.
e) Business combination: In accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in identifying
whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating
the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent consideration
assumed involves management judgment. These measurements are based on information available at the
acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by
management. Changes in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect the results of
operations. 
10
f) Other estimates: The preparation of financial statements involves estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets, liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Specifically, the Company
estimates the uncollectability of accounts receivable by analyzing historical payment patterns, customer
concentrations, customer credit-worthiness and current economic trends. If the financial condition of a
customer deteriorates, additional allowances may be required. Similarly, the Company provides for
inventory obsolescence, excess inventory and inventories with carrying values in excess of net realizable
value based on assessment of the future demand, market conditions and specific inventory management
initiatives. If market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than the Company’s estimates,
additional inventory provisions may be required. In all cases inventory is carried at the lower of historical
cost and net realizable value. The stock compensation expense is determined based on the Company’s
estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
Non-marketable equity investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently measured at fair value.
Fair value of investments is determined using the market and income approaches. The market approach
includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as revenue, earnings,
comparable performance multiples, recent financial rounds and the level of marketability of the investments.
The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors,
including comparable company sizes, growth rates, and development stages. The income approach includes
the use of discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees’ revenue,
costs, and discount rates based on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs
are developed using available historical and forecast data.
3. Significant accounting policies
 Please refer to the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended March 31, 2015 for a discussion of the
Company’s other critical accounting policies.
New Accounting standards adopted by the Company:
 The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements
for the year ended March 31, 2015, except for the adoption of amendments and interpretations effective as of
April 1, 2015. Although these amendments and amendments apply for the first time in the current financial year,
they do not have a material impact on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.
New accounting standards not yet adopted:
 A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for annual
periods beginning after April 1, 2015, and have not been applied in preparing these condensed consolidated
interim financial statements. New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that could have a
potential impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company are:
IFRS 9 – Financial instruments
 In July 2014, the IASB completed its project to replace IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement by publishing the final version of IFRS 9: Financial Instruments. IFRS 9 introduces a single
approach for the classification and measurement of financial assets according to their cash flow characteristics
and the business model they are managed in, and provides a new impairment model based on expected credit
losses. IFRS 9 also includes new guidance regarding the application of hedge accounting to better reflect an
entity’s risk management activities especially with regard to managing non-financial risks. The new standard is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, while early application is permitted.
The application of IFRS 9 may have a material impact on the classification, measurement and presentation of the
Company’s financial assets and liabilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 9 on
the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
11
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers

 IFRS 15 supersedes all existing revenue requirements in IFRS (IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IAS 18
Revenue and related interpretations). According to the new standard, revenue is recognized to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. IFRS 15 establishes a five step model that will
apply to revenue earned from a contract with a customer (with limited exceptions), regardless of the type of
revenue transaction or the industry. Extensive disclosures will be required, including disaggregation of total
revenue; information about performance obligation; changes in contract asset and liability account balances
between periods and key judgments and estimates. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or
cumulative effect transition method. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1,
2017; early application is permitted. In May 2015, the IASB, through an exposure draft, proposed changing the
effective date to periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 instead of January 1, 2017. The Company is
currently assessing the impact of adopting IFRS 15 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
